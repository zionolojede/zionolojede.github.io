<p> Here's a little bit about myself:

<p> It's rare that you'll find me not doing something related to sports. I have invested a lot of my lifetime in playing, debating, anaylzing, writing, videotaping, and enjoying sports. Basketball sits atop my list whether it's high school, college, international, or the pros. Check out this visualization I made, using Tableau, of the 2015-16 top scorers of the Patriot League:
